<p>lion, (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial “king of beasts,” the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. 
          Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland.
